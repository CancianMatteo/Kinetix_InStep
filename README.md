# Kinetix_InStep

To run the sketch "read-IMU-WiFiPubMQTT.ino" first create a header file called "credentials.h" in the same directory of the sketch, inside it write the following:

```
#pragma once

// === WiFi ===
#define WIFI_SSID "YOUR-SSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YOUR-PASSWORD"
```

(replacing YOUR-SSID and YOUR-PASSWORD with your actual credentials)
